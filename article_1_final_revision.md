# From Nation-States to Network States: Navigating the Challenges Ahead
Since 2021, the concept of the network state has emerged as a strong contender for the next iteration of global human organization, hoping to succeeding the nation-state model. Even in the last five years, [pop-up](https://www.edgecity.live) [cities](https://www.zuzalu.city) are multiplying, [blockchain](https://layerzero.network) [technology](https://www.erc4337.io) is creating prerequisite capabilities for [on-chain countries](https://pangea.web4.world), and [nation-states cannot ignore the power of the network](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/01/24/honduras-zedes-us-prospera-world-bank-biden-castro/). 

However, without exemplary business conduct, access to physical resources and weapons, or compelling missions to attract prospective citizens, network states face the risk of becoming merely tools for centralized authority rather than true successors to nation-states.

## Definitions
Before describing why the conditions stated earlier are critical to the success of network states, we must start with a definition of “network state” in order to maintain clarity around what kinds of entities require these conditions. A network state is “a social network with a moral innovation, a sense of national consciousness, a recognized founder, a capacity for collective action, an in-person level of civility, an integrated cryptocurrency, a consensual government limited by a social smart contract, an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories, a virtual capital, and an on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income, and real-estate footprint to attain a measure of diplomatic recognition.” 

I will also define network state "customers" in order to expand this framework by including not only citizens of the network state but also other nation-states and individual entities that engage with them. 

## Conducting Excellent Business
Network states will only be able to grow to the scope necessary for diplomatic recognition if it can trade in an honest manner while providing outstanding benefits to customers. Why can’t network states steal money or provide mediocre service? The ultimate sustainability of any organization hinges on whether it can indefinitely manage or suppress the social, legal, and economic repercussions of its conduct. Mediocre or dishonest non-monopolistic entities can only thrive with weak competition, overwhelming marketing, or structural barriers that disadvantage consumers. 

As network states are digital-first, the financial cost to begin is trivial and much of the code necessary to begin a digital organization is free to copy and modify for use, which encourages competition. Effective use of cutting-edge technology and limited manpower can enable competitors to produce substantially greater value for customers, providing them with wildly asymmetric advantages. With that in mind, competition between network states is at least as tough as that between tech startups today. As the movement continues to mature, “mediocre network states” will be an oxymoron because all network states that cannot provide fantastic value will have to close business in the hyper-competitive environment.

In the age of the Internet, it is almost impossible for any singular entity, let alone a network state, to produce such an overwhelming flood of self-promotion through the net that people cannot help but capitulate to their demands. Prospective citizens can and will conduct substantial research to determine if they are interested in joining a network state. If there is some issue with the network state’s conduct or benefits, a citizen can post online with little fear of suppression from the entity. Therefore, there is no way for "marketing" to sufficiently increase the reach of a network state that they can skimp on real-world benefits for customers because enough citizens-to-be will be able to pinpoint unfairness or harm from their dealings. For example, an organization like Balaji Srinivasan’s [Network School](https://balajis.com/p/network-school-2025) can do very little to suppress students’ testimonials about their previous experiences, especially not in the platforms where many of them congregate. Their future success will depend on the praises of cohorts of “citizens”, as will the success of network states to come in the digital age.

Finally, since network states are opt-in by design, they have little power to meaningfully prevent opt-out behavior. The only way a network state without a physical military of their own can force any citizen to remain as an active participant is if it colludes with other presiding entities like local or national governments or militaries to force citizens' hands. One may argue that such collusion would not be all that different from that between megacorporations like Walmart and Amazon and the US government. After all, their profits are augmented by direct or indirect government subsidies of some of the expenses of [Walmart](https://rmfu.org/taxpayer-dollars-subsidize-wal-mart/) or [Amazon](https://goodjobsfirst.org/amazon-tracker/). The government’s decision makers are happy to provide tax subsidies and much more to these companies in exchange for the companies’ contributions to their well-being because neither of these organizations’ activities threaten the US government’s ultimate control of their citizens. However, a network state by definition would seek to claim citizens from existing network states, directly conflicting with the interests of nation-state governments and making similar collusion unlikely. 

## Acquiring Physical Assets
One might argue that it is sufficient for network states simply to spend money in local economies. After all, digital nomads do just that and they are (often) allowed to continue their work peacefully in the area. If network states can acquire and maintain the physical resources it needs with only permanent land fixtures, this might be acceptable to their temporary hosts, as they are merely businesspeople. However, establishing a physical domicile or facility in any locale requires legal permanent use of finite and localized resources such as land (by definition), local utilities, and housing for any personnel permanently based working in the facility. If those resources are metered by the presiding entity, they have the ultimate authority to remove any access the network state claims on them.

In order to understand why a network state requires physical assets, we must first understand why a sovereign entity cannot exist without a real-world domain in its control. If an entity answers in any way to another jurisdiction with respect to the ultimate ownership of the land on which it resides, by definition there is another power able to exert its will over you at any time. If the higher jurisdiction so chooses, your use of the land and its associated resources will be limited to whatever they allow, and if you refuse, men with guns will arrive at your door to order you to comply. If you do not have the means to resist such orders, you cannot be sovereign. 

In other words, your ability to produce and resist coercive violence is (dare I say it?) central to the full sovereignty of any entity. As of this writing, all existing network states are in one way or another subservient to some national jurisdiction. For example, Prospera, one of the most complete network state projects to date, [still currently has to answer to the Honduran government](https://news.mongabay.com/2024/12/foreign-investor-lawsuits-impede-honduras-human-rights-environment-protections/). Prospera does not currently have adequate means to resist forced compliance from the Honduran government in a manner that is recognized as legitimate on an international stage because it is an economic zone within a nation-state rather than a state in and of itself.

Finally, as network states cannot exist without people's passion, money, and energy, they cannot put together the means to defend themselves without the will of at least some of their citizens to raise arms in defense of their sovereignty. Even if no citizens are physically present on any battlefield, the combatants (or those building them) still risk life and limb because their actions put them at risk of pinpointed targeting from any entity with the cybersecurity capabilities to determine a digital individual's precise location. But why would a network state citizen even consider risking his life for his network state?

## Offering Compelling Missions
Network states have to have sufficiently strong missions to convince individuals and groups to devote not only their allegiance, but their effort and potentially their physical presence as well in the form of immigration. Without an incredibly compelling ideological North Star, a network state cannot hope to obtain the human capital required to establish globally recognized sovereignty. Network states have to offer a vision and mission to its prospective citizens that motivates individuals to discard their previous national and cultural identities to commit fully to the endeavor. This mission should promise prospects of a better life, not merely through economic gain but also through meaningful participation in something larger than personal interests. 

Moreover, the network state's mission has to inspire hope in a better future for society. If a network state can provide a dream to prospective citizens similar to the dreams that have inspired people to move between nation states, that should be sufficient to retain citizens beyond economic purposes. And as successors to nation-states, they have to portray powerful dreams and visions to the world in place of the tales told about the countries of today and yesterday.

Furthermore, cultivating a strong sense of belonging within the network state is crucial. Citizens should feel connected to a shared identity and purpose, forming a genuine community rather than a collection of individuals pursuing individualistic gains. Common culture among network state citizens, regardless of previous national, ethnic, or linguistic identity, can facilitate a strong enough sense of belonging to motivate prospective citizens to renounce their previous identities and call themselves citizens of the network state.

## Addressing Difficult Challenges
In order to succeed nation-states, network states will need to expand honest business dealings with customers, acquire and develop permanent territory and physical assets, and sing to the souls of prospective citizens. If it can accomplish these gargantuan milestones, the network state movement can ultimately succeed the global nation-state model instead of becoming its subsidiary. 

The movement is growing. But there is still much to be done.
