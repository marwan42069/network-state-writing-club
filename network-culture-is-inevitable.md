# Network Culture is Inevitable

What influences an individual's understanding of culture? Is it language? Is it religion? Is it friends and family? Is it school? Or is it a series of AI-driven algorithms personalized to individuals' tastes? Increasingly in the past twenty years or so, it's the very last item. People consume more algorithm-driven social media than any other kind of media, and by doing so, they are consuming less centralized local culture. This trend will continue to influence people's minds and increase the ideological distance between individuals who may be geographically or ethnically very close.

* Throughout human history, people have consumed the media and entertainment available to their language and locale
* Pre-mass media, people could only get books or local culture (citation needed)
    * It wasn’t impossible to experience different cultures, but it was much much harder than it is today
* Now everyone has individualized media they consume
* The largest amount of media people with internet consume today is from social media with individualized algorithms rather than mass media where you can only choose that thing from that medium
* This is a large part of the inputs people get into their brains, and it will inevitably shape their behavior and actions and beliefs much more strongly than existing shared institutions do like school or work
* As centralized legacy (post-WW2 pre-Internet) institutions continue to fade into irrelevancy, the sense of local belonging will continue to shrink
    * People will eventually feel too disconnected to their neighbors, and they will need to be able to more easily find their people
    * A growing number of people feel “culturally homeless”, sufficiently dissociated from their national cultures and ethnic cultures that cultural intelligibility is missing in the person’s geographical environment
* In order to solve this, people need to be able to congregate with those who have same beliefs, and those people will be geographically disparate too
* Enter network culture
    * We already kinda have the start of this with hobby forums and online communities and subcultures such as otaku, but this is only the beginning
    * But people will eventually have to get their values and core beliefs from systems outside of centralized geographical/ethnic/linguistic institutions
* People with certain values tend to gravitate towards certain hobbies
    * e.g. people mostly only talk about whatever the particular interest is in their particular subgroup or hobby, but it’s possible there might be other interests that mesh with values
* I wonder if it would be beneficial if we had a medium or media through which people can cross-examine interests and values and ultimately group themselves together more cohesively in a manner based on core beliefs 
    * Still fleshing out potential solutions to solve this cultural homelessness
