# From Nation-States to Network States: A Roadmap for the Future?

Since 2021, the concept of the network state has emerged as a strong contender for the next iteration of global human organization, hoping to succeeding the nation-state model. In a few short years, individuals and organizations on the frontiers of technology, community development, and biomedicine have already built out some of the necessary groundwork in order to make network states viable. These accomplishments include [creating spaces in which people can safely and freely experiment with social, technological, and medical innovations](https://www.prospera.co/en), [promoting co-creation and community building in intergenerational neighborhoods](https://cabin.city), and building [sufficiently decentralized social networks](https://www.varunsrinivasan.com/2022/01/11/sufficient-decentralization-for-social-networks), and [much](https://quilibrium.com) [more](https://soci3ty.org). However, without substantial economic and non-economic value, access to physical resources, or compelling missions to attract prospective citizens, network states face the risk of becoming merely tools for centralized authority rather than true successors to nation-states.

## Definitions
Before describing why the conditions stated earlier are critical to the success of network states, we must start with a definition of “network state” in order to maintain clarity around what kinds of entities require these conditions. A network state is “a social network with a moral innovation, a sense of national consciousness, a recognized founder, a capacity for collective action, an in-person level of civility, an integrated cryptocurrency, a consensual government limited by a social smart contract, an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories, a virtual capital, and an on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income, and real-estate footprint to attain a measure of diplomatic recognition.” 

I will also refer to network state “customers”, which includes not only citizens of these “communities” but other entities with whom the network state is transacting and providing value, including existing nation-states. 

## Exemplary Value-Add
Network states will only be able to grow to the scope necessary for diplomatic recognition if it can trade in an honest manner while providing outstanding benefits to customers. Why can’t network states steal money or provide mediocre service? The ultimate sustainability of any organization hinges on whether it can indefinitely manage or suppress the social, legal, and economic repercussions of its conduct. Mediocre or dishonest non-monopolistic entities can only thrive with weak competition, overwhelming marketing, or structural barriers that disadvantage consumers. 

As network states are digital-first, the cost to begin is trivial, which encourages competition. Additionally, effective use of technology can provide competitors with wildly asymmetric advantages, so competition between network states is theoretically among the toughest in any facet of human society. In the age of the Internet, it is almost impossible for any singular entity, let alone a network state, to produce such an overwhelming flood of self-promotion through the net that people cannot help but capitulate to their demands. Finally, the only way a network state can force any citizen to remain as an active participant is if it colludes with other presiding entities like local or national governments or militaries to force citizens' hands. Governments and militaries that have any understanding of the power of the internet and its implications will consider network states as competitors, not as allies, making network-nation state collusion highly unlikely.

In addition to substantial trade, network states must contribute tangible value in addition to money injections to the people of the locales they inhabit. Rather than merely injecting money into local economies, they should offer cultural, social, or technological advancements that enhance the local community’s well-being. Failure to do so will lead to perceptions of freeloading or exploitation, which will motivate local residents to attack the network states that they feel are depriving them of resources or benefits. Furthermore, an appearance of significant economic output, even if seen as valuable to the locale's permanent residents, will at minimum compel established political organizations to take what they believe to be their fair share of the network state's spoils. Fortunately, network states can mitigate these possibilities with an ample cache of weapons, land, minerals, infrastructure, and other physical resources.

## Physical Assets
One might argue that it is sufficient for network states simply to spend money in local economies because digital nomads are merely individual “network states.” If network states can acquire and maintain the physical resources it needs with only permanent land fixtures, this might be acceptable to their temporary hosts, as they are merely businesspeople. However, establishing a physical domicile in any locale requires legal permanent use of finite and localized resources such as land (by definition), local electricity, local water, and housing for anyone permanently based there. If those resources are metered by the presiding entity, they have the ultimate authority to remove any access the network state claims on them.

In order to understand why a network state requires physical assets, we must first understand why a sovereign entity cannot exist without a real-world domain in its control. If an entity answers in any way to another jurisdiction with respect to the ultimate ownership of the land on which it resides, by definition there is another power able to exert its will over you at any time. If the higher jurisdiction so chooses, your use of the land and its associated resources will be limited to whatever they allow, and if you refuse, men with guns will arrive at your door to order you to comply. If you do not have the means to resist such orders, you cannot be sovereign. In other words, your ability to produce and resist coercive violence is (dare I say it?) central to the full sovereignty of any entity. As of this writing, all existing network states are in one way or another subservient to some national jurisdiction. For example, Prospera, one of the most complete network state projects to date, still currently has to answer to the Honduran government. They do not currently have adequate means to resist forced compliance from the Honduran government in a manner that is recognized as legitimate on an international stage.

Finally, as network states cannot exist without people's passion, money, and energy, they cannot put together the means to defend themselves without the will of at least some of their citizens to raise arms in defense of their sovereignty. Even if no citizens are physically present on any battlefield, the combatants (or those building them) still risk life and limb because their actions put them at risk of pinpointed targeting from any entity with the cybersecurity capabilities to determine a digital individual's precise location. But why would a network state citizen even consider risking his life for his network state?

## Compelling Missions
Without an incredibly compelling ideological North Star, a network state cannot hope to obtain the human capital required to establish globally recognized sovereignty. Network states have to offer a vision and mission to its prospective citizens that motivates individuals to discard their previous national and cultural identities in order to commit fully to the endeavor. This mission should promise prospects of a better life, not merely through economic gain but also through meaningful participation in something larger than personal interests. Moreover, the network state's mission has to inspire hope in a better future for society. If a network state can provide a dream to prospective citizens similar to the dreams that have inspired people to move between nation states, that should be sufficient to retain citizens beyond economic purposes. 

Furthermore, cultivating a strong sense of belonging within the network state is crucial. Citizens should feel connected to a shared identity and purpose, forming a genuine community rather than a collection of individuals pursuing individualistic gains. Common culture among network state citizens, regardless of previous national, ethnic, or linguistic identity, can facilitate a strong enough sense of belonging to motivate prospective citizens to renounce their previous identities and call themselves citizens of the network state.

## Counterarguments
Given the ideas presented above, it's possible that a network state taking root in a less stable and powerful national jurisdiction with a lower local cost of operation might be able to amass enough money through dishonest or substandard service to customers to stronghold local authorities into compliance with its will. However, such a network state will violate the defintion above. (more TBD)
